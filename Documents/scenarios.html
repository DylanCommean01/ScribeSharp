                <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
                <p>As an educator, I want to be able to import presentations and slideshows. This is to be performed in a manner that will accept most document/word processing file extensions. Such file extensions include but are not limited to .doc, .ppt, .excel, .txt. Additionally, this is to be done so that previous and future presentations will be stored within a local folder specific for ScribeSharp.
                </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
                <p>As an educator, I want to be able to host an online session. This online session should be available to all students within the class. Availability and all functionality is limited to students with the software already downloaded as well as students with a registered account. Given the possibility of students joining classes that he or she is not enrolled for, a verification of some sort is required to check students enrollment status.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
                <p>As an educator, I want to be able to ensure that all students in the hosted online session are using the external applications which are recommended for that specific online session. The option to select other external applications should not be recommended nor available. External applications should help and aid students in a subject-specific learning environment. Such tools include but are not limited to, a Java compiler using the Jni4net Framework, custom math tools (interest rate calculator, conventional calculator, pythagorean theorem calculator, etc), and the C#/.NET compiler using the Rosyln. 
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 4</h2>
                <p>As a student, I want to be able to create a document entitled a reference name of my choice. After entitling a document, a blank document will be presented. This document should allow for text characters to be entered. At any point in time, any student should be allowed to save the text document to a local folder located on the student’s computer.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 5</h2>
                <p>As a student, I want to be able to view a collection of previous notes that have been saved in the past. Once a preview for a specific note has been displayed, accessing such a note should be as simple as just clicking on it using an external mouse. Additionally, should I choose to sort my notes via subject, the software should then display a collection of notes specific to the selected subject.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 6</h2>
                <p>As a student, I should be able to access an online hosted session by clicking an easy-to-read button. This should connect to a session with an educator whose join code is still active. An active join code refers to a professor who has enabled the option to have students join their class at any point in time during the online session.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 7</h2>
                <p>As a student, I want to be able to take notes via the software while viewing the educator’s imported notes. This should be in a blank canvas and should allow for styling of the text such as highlighting text and text size. A button to maximize and minimize these notes should be displayed so that the educators’ screen is displayed to a maximal or minimal size. For organizational purposes, the note background color is able to change color depending on the student’s choice. If a background color with a relatively low contrast to the default text of the notes is selected, the default text will change to a color that represents a higher contrast. This is executed automatically and without discretion of the student.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 8</h2>
                <p>As a student, I want to be able to share my current viewed computer screen with my educator and other students within the online session. This should be in a formal manner in which the educator must approve of this action before the screen can be shared. This process is critical because students should not be able to constantly interrupt other students’ education and/or educators’ notes. Additionally, an option to discontinue use of screen sharing should be able to be selected at any point during the use of the screen sharing service.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 9</h2>
                <p>As an anonymous user, I want to be able to have the option to register an account. A critical part of the registration process is to have the option to register as a student or as an educator. The registration process includes having the student or educator submit the following required fields of information: username, password, purpose, institution. The following fields are included in the registration process but are not required: age, gender.
            </p></div><br>

            <div class="story">
                <h2>Scenario 10</h2>
                <p>As a student or an educator, I want to be able to have the option to login to my registered account. Upon successful credentials, username and password, I should be directed to a screen specific to my account. On the other hand, as a student or an educator, I want to also be able to log out of my registered account. In doing so, the main screen should display options and links specific to the login and registration process.
